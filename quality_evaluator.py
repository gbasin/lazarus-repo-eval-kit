UNIFIED_EVALUATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert AI judge specializing in the evaluation of software engineering benchmarks.

Your task is to assess the quality of a benchmark instance based on the following criteria.
Analyze the following and score on ALL rubrics. Lower scores are better.

============================================================
PROBLEM STATEMENT
============================================================
{problem_statement}

============================================================
HINTS (if any)
============================================================
{hints}

============================================================
SOURCE CODE CHANGES (gold_src.diff)
============================================================
{src_diff}

============================================================
TEST CHANGES (gold_test.diff)
============================================================
{test_diff}

============================================================
EVALUATION CRITERIA
============================================================

**1. ISSUE CLARITY** (0-3): How clear is the problem statement?
- 0 = FULLY CLEAR: Well-specified; success criteria obvious (includes what must change and what counts as success).
- 1 = MOSTLY CLEAR: Some gaps, but a sensible solution is still inferable (you can describe a concrete fix with minor guesswork).
- 2 = VAGUE: Success criteria missing or incomplete (you cannot tell what exactly needs to be done, only the general area/problem).
- 3 = EXTREMELY UNCLEAR: Cannot be solved without major external information.

**Strict rules for Issue Clarity:**
- If issue body does NOT explicitly describe expected behavior or acceptance criteria → assign ≥2 (never 0/1).
- If statement only gives motivation, screenshots, or links without precise requirements → assign 2.
- If statement is a crash log/stack trace without context, but fix direction is guessable → assign 1.
- If nothing actionable is provided. → assign 3.

**Notes on the definition of actionable:**
- It has to be explicit not implicit.
- It has to require non-test changes requests.
- If the problem statement only requests test changes, then this is not actionable.

**2. TEST-TO-ISSUE ALIGNMENT** (0-3): How well do tests validate the stated issue?
- 0 = PERFECT: Tests directly check the required behavior in the issue, and nothing unrelated.
- 1 = GOOD: Tests cover majority of correct solutions, but some edge cases or alternative implementations may not be caught.
- 2 = PARTIAL: Tests validate *some aspect* of the issue, but add extra constraints or miss some reasonable correct solutions.
- 3 = POOR: Tests fail to check core requirement of the issue, or check something entirely unrelated.

**Strict rules for Test-to-Issue Alignment:**
- If tests do NOT exercise the main behavior or bug described → assign 3.
- If tests over-specify beyond issue scope (e.g., exact error message wording not specified, custom attributes not mentioned) → assign 2.
- If tests pass for solutions that don't actually fix the issue → lean toward 3.
- Never assign 0 unless tests directly validate the issue's stated fix.

**3. GOLD PATCH CLARITY** (0-3): How readable is the code change?
- 0 = CLEAR: Clean, focused, easy to follow. Minor quirks okay.
- 1 = UNDERSTANDABLE: Takes effort but you can figure it out. Some inconsistencies.
- 2 = VAGUE: Hard to follow, poor practices, lacks structure.
- 3 = UNCLEAR: Unreadable nightmare, no structure, no clarity.

**4. PATCH-TO-ISSUE ALIGNMENT** (0-3): Does the patch match the problem?
- 0 = ATOMIC: Fully and exactly addresses the problem—nothing more, nothing less.
- 1 = OVER-SCOPED: Solves problem but adds non-essential/unrelated changes.
- 2 = UNDER-SCOPED: Only partially addresses the problem, missing key elements.
- 3 = NON-ATOMIC: Doesn't address problem, or bundles unrelated changes (dev merge, multi-fix).

**5. TEST CLARITY** (0-3): Are the tests understandable?
- 0 = CLEAR: Focused, well-named, covers intent with no readability issues.
- 1 = UNDERSTANDABLE: Takes effort, weak naming, tests multiple things.
- 2 = VAGUE: Confusing setup, poor naming, unclear what's being tested.
- 3 = UNCLEAR: Unreadable noise, can't tell what's being tested or why.

**6. FALSE NEGATIVE (FN)** (0-3): Will tests reject valid alternative solutions?
- 0 = FULLY GENERALIZED: Accepts all correct implementations.
- 1 = GENERALIZED: Accepts most, rare edge case rejections.
- 2 = RESTRICTIVE: Rejects many valid alternatives.
- 3 = OVERLY RESTRICTIVE: Only accepts near-identical solutions.

**7. FALSE POSITIVE (FP)** (0-3): Will tests catch incorrect solutions?
- 0 = FULLY STRICT: Catches all bugs including edge cases.
- 1 = STRICT: Catches most bugs, misses some subtle ones.
- 2 = SUPERFICIAL: Only catches obvious bugs.
- 3 = OVERLY PERMISSIVE: Accepts clearly broken solutions.

**8. TASK DIFFICULTY** (0-3): How hard is this to fix?
- 0 = TRIVIAL: <15 min fix (e.g., adding assertions to a function).
- 1 = EASY: 15 min - 1 hour (small change requiring some thought).
- 2 = MEDIUM: 1-4 hours (substantial rewrite or multi-file edit).
- 3 = HARD: >4 hours (esoteric issue, >100 lines of code changes).
